Axis geometry
=============

This class creates a simple object with a plane on each 3D plane of (XY,
XZ, YZ) There is also a factory that is registered as a component.

Axis object
-----------

Can we create one from the class?

>>> import geometry.axis
>>> axis = geometry.axis.Axis(10, None)
>>> axis # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<geometry.axis.Axis object at 0x...>

Are the vertices correct?

>>> axis.vertices # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<glhelpers.c_float_Array_36 object at 0x...>

Axis factory
------------

Is the factory working?

>>> factory = geometry.axis.AxisFactory()
>>> factory # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<geometry.axis.AxisFactory object at 0x...>

Can we make an axis?

>>> created_axis = factory.create()
>>> created_axis # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<geometry.axis.Axis object at 0x...>

Axis component
--------------

Lookup the component.

>>> import zope.component
>>> import geometry.interfaces
>>> gsm = zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager()
>>> util = gsm.getUtility(geometry.interfaces.IGeometryFactory,
...                       'Axis')

Check we got the right thing.

>>> util # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
<geometry.axis.AxisFactory object at 0x...>
