Position classes
================

Positions in space are represented using these classes. The two major
factors are displacement from the origin of the position and the
rotational orientation.

Identity position
-----------------

The identity position is a position that doesn't change the displacement
or orientation. We should end up with two tuples with all zeros.

>>> import geometry.position
>>> identity = geometry.position.Position()
>>> identity.position
((0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0, 0.0))

Displacement
------------

Great. Now lets try creating a position with a displacement on the X
axis:

>>> x_displacement = geometry.position.Position((1.0,0.0,0.0))
>>> x_displacement.position
((1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
>>> x_displacement.displacement
(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

Good stuff. Now for a position with a y displacement.

>>> y_displacement = geometry.position.Position((0.0,1.0,0.0))
>>> y_displacement.displacement
(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)

Absolute position
-----------------

We should be able to take a position, (a relative measure,) and combine
it with an origin to get an absolute position.

>>> absolute_position = x_displacement.absolute_position(y_displacement)
>>> absolute_position.displacement
(1.0, 1.0, 0.0)

It looks like it has resolved that correctly. Let's check it works out
for another example.

>>> x = x_displacement
>>> y = y_displacement
>>> left = x.absolute_position(identity)
>>> leftleft = x.absolute_position(left)
>>> leftleftup = y.absolute_position(leftleft)
>>> leftleftup.displacement
(2.0, 1.0, 0.0)
