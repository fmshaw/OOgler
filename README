OOgler - Pyglet scene graph
===========================

Introduction
------------

Pyglet provides OpenGL bindings for Python, I'm hoping to add a
scene graph layer on top. The idea being to make it easy to represent an
object system as a 3D environment.

Prerequisites
-------------

Pyglet for the OpenGL stuff and windowing
Zope for the component system
Python 2.6.2 (well that's the one I'm using)

Thanks
------

I would like to thank Txema Vicente for their very helpful newbie code:
